                          God to literally give this song to the world, for the
                          thrilling story leading to its writing and
                          development.</p>
                          
                          <p class="body_text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; in it's original form
                          came from Sweden in 1885, almost 100 years ago. It was
                          a poem written by Carl Boberg, a 26-year old preacher,
                          in the summer of 1885 under the title &quot;O Store
                          Gud&quot; which is translated &quot;O Great God.&quot;
                          It was a warm summer day. Carl and some of his friends
                          had gone to a meeting some 2 miles from home. On the
                          way back they were caught in a thunder storm. As the
                          storm broke, the lightning flashed, the thunder
                          rolled, and the winds swept across the fields; and
                          then, as quickly as it came, it was all over. The sun
                          again came out and with it appeared a rainbow. Then,
                          as the rainbow disappeared and the sun began to sink
                          low in the west in the thrill of the evening, from a
                          distance could be heard the song of&nbsp;the thrush
                          and the church tower sounding the tolling of the bell
                          memorializing&nbsp; a funeral that had been held that
                          afternoon. The very atmosphere, the beauty of the
                          surroundings, and the sound of the bell---all combined
                          to draw from the heart and mind of the young preacher
                          a poem, the subject of which after many translations
                          in many lands and after many years would become known
                          as &quot;How Great Thou Art.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Translation helped enrich
                          the poem as each country added it's own particular
                          &quot;flavor,&quot; but it was an English missionary
                          by the name of Stuart K. Hine who worked in the
                                western Ukraine and later in Sub-Carpathian
                                Russia, who gave us the inspiring original
                                English words as we know them today. As one
                                looks back, one can't help but see the hand of
                                God sending Hine to the particular area in which
                                he worked, for he later said, &quot;God put me
                                amid unforgettable experiences in the Carpathian
                                Mountains.&quot; These experiences, plus the
                                grandeur and beauty of his surroundings, did
                                much to flood Hine with the feeling of awe and
                                wonder at so great a God. This would eventually
                                lead him to describe all of this in his own way
                                and words.&nbsp;<br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In giving his account of
                          events leading to the writing, Hine recalls the first
                          Carpathian Mountain Village to which he climbed. He
                          stood in the street, sang a Gospel hymn, and read
                          aloud John, chapter three. But a storm was gathering
                          and soon he had taken shelter in the home a friendly
                          schoolmaster who had been listening.
                          &quot;Awe-inspiring was 'the mighty thunder' echoing
                          through the mountains&quot; was the way he described
                          the experience which would be the seed-thought for his
                          first stanza.<br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traveling on, Hine crossed
                          the mountain frontier into Romania. There in Bukovina
                          (the land of the beech tree) he found believers&nbsp;
                          young and old alike. Together &quot;through the woods
                          and forest glades&quot; they wandered and &quot;heard
                          the birds sing sweetly in the trees.&quot; To the
                          accompaniment of mandolins and guitars, they too burst
                          into song singing the Russian version of &quot;How
                          Great Thou Art.&quot; Thus inspired by the awesome
                          wonder of the surroundings, &quot;the works thy hands
                          have made,&quot; the beautiful melody and the earlier
                          mountain experience with it's &quot;mighty
                          thunder,&quot; there burst forth into life from the
                          heart and mind of missionary Hine, the first two
                          stanzas:<p class="poem_text">O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder<br>
                          Consider all the works thy hands have made,<br>
                          I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,<br>
                          Thy pow'r throu' out the universe displayed.<br>
                          <br>
                          When through the woods and forest glades I wander<br>
                          And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;<br>
                          When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,<br>
                          And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,...<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                          As Hine continued his work of preaching and
                          distributing Gospels in village after village and had
                          traveled some 125 miles, he had an experience which
                          would give life to verse 3. He met a man and his wife
                          who had owned a Bible for almost 20 years (it had been
                          left by a fleeing Russian soldier) but they could not
                          read it. The very year that Hine met them the wife had
                          taken the Bible and had made up her mind she would
                          learn to read it, and in turn, began to read it to the
                          villagers who in wonder listened as she slowly and
                          haltingly read the most wonderful story of the
                          crucifixion. Tears began to flow as men and women fell
                          to their knees crying to God. It was at that precise
                          time that Stuart K. Hine came upon the scene and
                          witnessed the amazing happening---people seeing the
                          revelation of God's love at Calvary for the first
                          time. It was then that he conceived stanza three:
                          
                          <p class="poem_text">And when I think that God, His son not sparing,<br>
                          Sent Him to die---I scarce can take it in;<br>
                          That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,<br>
                          He bled and died, to take away my sin.<p>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                          It was some 10 years later (1948) that he conceived
                          the fourth stanza. God used the years in between to
                          impress upon Hine's heart the importance of the
                          words&nbsp; &quot;home&quot; and &quot;heaven&quot; as
                          he worked among the many World War II refugees in
                          Britain. The first question they would ask was,
                          &quot;When are we going home?&quot; At such a time,
                          what better message could he give them but of the One
                          who had gone to prepare a better home and who had
                          promised to come someday to take His children home
                          with Him forever to a place called Heaven. And so from
                          his heart and these experiences there came the fourth
                          stanza.
                          <p class="poem_text">When Christ shall come with shout of
                          acclamation<br>
                          And take me home---what joy shall fill my heart!<br>
                          Then I shall bow in humble adoration,<br>
