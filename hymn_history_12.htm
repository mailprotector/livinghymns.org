                            this beautiful carol was called &quot;Home&quot; the
                            mother of a little girl of five, who had been one
                            of his
                            special favorites, entered the room where the child
                            was playing. Holding the little face between
                            her hands, she said tearfully, &quot;Bishop
                            Brooks has gone to Heaven.&quot; &quot;
                            Oh, Mama!&quot; was the reply, &quot;How happy the
                            angels will be!&quot; This little true story paints
                            but a part of the story of Phillips Brooks - preacher
                            extraordinare, lover of children, gifted orator,
                            poet, and above all, a believer - with all
                            his soul - in the divine Son of God of whom he preached
                            and for whom he lived.                          </p>
                          
                          <hr color="#993333" align="left" noshade>
                          <p class="bodytext">The idea for this song had been
                            simmering in the heart of Phillips Brooks since 1865
                            when, on a trip abroad, he was able to spend Christmas
                            in Bethlehem. This for his
                            day, was unusual and was an experience he would never
                            forget. On Sunday, December 24, he rode on horseback
                            from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and as twilight was
                            falling, he went out to the field where tradition
                            says the shepherds saw the glory of the Lord. As
                            he looked toward the little town of Bethlehem, with
                            the moon acting as the illuminator and the stars
                            shining in the sky, he witnessed a scene much the
                            same as the shepherds had witnessed
                            almost 2000 years before.<br>
                            <br>
                            Except for the absence
                            of the great light and the shepherds, nothing had
                            changed very much. Instead of a candle to light their
                            way, some who were traveling through the quiet streets
                            were using lamps. There also were no angels present,
                            yet the aura of the occasion lent a holy hush to
                            the surroundings. Speaking of this experience in
                            a letter to his Sunday school in Philadelphia, Phillips
                            Brooks wrote, &quot;<em>Again and again it seemed
                            I could hear voices telling each other of the `Wonderful
                            Night' of the Saviour's birth.</em>&quot;<br>
                            <br>
                            All this while
                            the words of a new carol were singing in his heart,
                            but it would not be until he came home to America
                            that he would write them down. This would not happen
                            until just a short while before Christmas 1868. He
                            was preparing the Christmas service for the Sunday
                            school and as he began to review the music he would
                            use, there flooded through his soul a re-echo of
                            the Christmas Eve he had spent in the shepherd fields
                            overlooking Bethlehem, and the carol that had been
                            singing in his heart since that time. He could contain
                            it no longer, and as it burst forth, he began to
                            write:
                            <div align="center"><em><strong><font color="#666666">O little town of Bethlehem,<br>
                            How still we see thee lie!<br>
                            Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,<br>
                            The silent stars
                            go by</font></strong></em><font color="#666666">.</font><br>
                            <br>
                            </div>
                            On and on it flowed until, as a river reaches the
                            sea, so his inspired words too reached the zenith
                            of what Christmas is all about as he exclaims, &quot;0
                            come to us, abide with us, Our Lord, Emmanuel!&quot; <br>
                            <br>
                            Phillips
                            Brooks then hurriedly left his study and walked to
                            the home of Mr. Lewis Redner, who was the
                            organist of the church. Upon showing him his poem,
                            Mr. Redner consented to try his hand at writing an
                            appropriate melody. His effort proved successful,
                            and today in all of hymnology there can be found
                            no tune which so greatly enhances a set of words
                            as does this one.<br>
                            <br> 
                            There were many very happy children
                            that Christmas in the Sunday school of The Church
                            of the Holy Trinity
                            in Philadelphia as they sang, for the first time,
                            the carol that their own pastor had written for them.
                            In the years to come, it would be an important part
                            of each of their Christmas celebrations but
                            it would take more than twenty years before it would
                            receive general recognition and be sung around the
                            world. ABS<img border="0" src="images/signature.gif" align="right" width="100" height="39">
